This is an example of how to take previously created main population and trial cohort and and run stochastic simulations of the individuals in the cohort. 

First load the package (install it first if necessary as shown in the [Installation article](https://keithjf82.github.io/vectorpower/articles/B_installation.html):

```{r setup}
library(vectorpower)
```

In this example, the main population and cohort data sets are loaded from RDS files created by saving the results of running the mainpop() function (see [Worked Example 2](https://keithjf82.github.io/vectorpower/articles/D_worked_example02.html)) and the clusters_create() function ( see [Worked Example 3](https://keithjf82.github.io/vectorpower/articles/E_worked_example03.html)).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load main population data
mainpop_data <- readRDS(file=url("https://github.com/KeithJF82/vectorpower/raw/master/inst/extdata/mainpop_data.Rds"))

# Load control and intervention cluster data
cluster_list_con <-readRDS(file=url("https://github.com/KeithJF82/vectorpower/raw/master/inst/extdata/cluster_list_con.Rds"))
cluster_list_int <-readRDS(file=url("https://github.com/KeithJF82/vectorpower/raw/master/inst/extdata/cluster_list_int.Rds"))
```

Malaria progression in the trial cohort in each cluster is evaluated using the cohort() function, which runs the stochastic individual-based malaria model (the code for which is found in cohort.cpp in the src/ folder). Here the control group of clusters is simulated:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate control clusters
cohort_data_con <- cohort(mainpop_data=mainpop_data,cluster_data=cluster_list_con,
                          output_folder=control_folder,prop_T_c = 0.9,n_patients = 100,
                          age_start = 0.5,age_end = 10.0)
```

The intervention clusters are simulated in the same way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Simulate intervention clusters
cohort_data_int <- cohort(mainpop_data=mainpop_data,cluster_data=cluster_list_int,
                          output_folder=control_folder,prop_T_c = 0.9,n_patients = 100,
                          age_start = 0.5,age_end = 10.0)
```
