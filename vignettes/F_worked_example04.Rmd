```

This is an example of how to take previously created main population and trial cohort and and run stochastic simulations of the individuals in the cohort. 

First load the package (install it first if necessary as shown in the [Installation article](https://keithjf82.github.io/vectorpower/articles/B_installation.html):

```{r setup}
library(vectorpower)
```

In this example, the main population and cohort data is loaded from an RDS file.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mainpop_data <- readRDS(file=url(""))
```
